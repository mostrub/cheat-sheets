# Englisch Integrating Email-to-Ticket Feature in GLPI

GLPI (Gestionnaire Libre de Parc informatique) is an open-source IT Asset Management, issue tracking system, and service desk system. One of its key features is the ability to convert emails into tickets, streamlining the issue management process. Here's how to set up and use this feature:

1. **Email Configuration**: Configure an email account in GLPI to receive emails for ticket conversion. GLPI supports both IMAP and POP3 protocols.
2. **Email Reception Rules**: Set up rules to manage incoming emails. These rules define which emails are converted into tickets and their categorization, based on criteria like subject line keywords or sender's address.
3. **Ticket Creation**: GLPI automatically creates a ticket from an email that meets the predefined rules, using the email's content and attachments.
4. **Notification and Assignment**: Notifications are sent to the relevant support team or individual once a ticket is created. Assignments can be manual or automatic, based on set criteria.
5. **Tracking and Resolution**: The ticket goes through a lifecycle from opening to resolution, with the support team updating status, adding notes, and resolving the issue.
6. **Feedback and Closure**: After resolution, feedback can be requested from the ticket creator before closing the ticket.
